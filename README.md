# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Deep-learning-Approach-and-using-Grad-CAM-for-Visualization

## About
Pneumonia Detection from X-ray images using several pretrained Deep learning Models as VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50, MobileNetV2 in addition to a proposed CNN Architecture.
We used the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" Dataset from Kaggle. In this repository we implemented the "Clinical Decision Support Systems for Pneumonia Diagnosis Using Gradient-Weighted 
Class Activation Mapping and Convolutional Neural Networks Thao Minh Nguyen" paper (link of the paper will be included at the end of the README File).

## Approaches
In Our Implemetation 2 Approaches Can be used:

1. Using Augmentation
2. Without Augmentation (Combining The train & val images for training)
